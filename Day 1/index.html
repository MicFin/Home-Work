	<h1>Dan Reineberg</h1>
		<h2>Hello My Name is...</h2>
	<p>
	Dan. I'm a UX/UI Designer creating up in Boston. I've always had a passion for figuring out how things work, why things work, and how I can make them work better. This genuine curiosity is what drove me into the world of UX and design. I'm currently the lead UX/UI designer for a diversified technology solutions agency, working to find a balance between the creative and calculated in design.

	When I'm not in front of my Mac you'll likely find me out hiking with my lab, Ziggy, sipping on a cold craft beer, or testing my culinary skills in the kitchen.
